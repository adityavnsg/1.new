github:one of the remote repository hosting service
git :vcs(version control sytem where u can push and store yur code to a remote repository)
1.versions ni store chesukovadaniki u need a remote place bez eppudina miru upgrade chesinnapudu new version lo bugs vaste u have to move to old version again
so for storing this u need a palce
2.project ni save chesukuntam

1.remote repository --->ekkado server lo vunna ni folder/package
2.local repository---->ni server lo vunna folder or package
3.staging area
4.working directory ---->untracked files 
(git init ---it initializes the working dir
git status it shows some of the fikes are untracked

git add file names
 that u have to change bz we cannot give multip,e files at a time to add
staging area--->‌git commit -m"message"
local repository:

branch :
What are Branches in Git?
A branch is a pointer to a commit.

Git branches are a snapshot of a project and its changes, from a specific point in time.

When working on a big project, there is the main repository with all the code, often called main or master.

Branching allows you to create new, independent versions of the original main working project. You might create a branch to edit it to make changes, to add a new feature, or to write a test when you're trying to fix a bug. And a new branch lets you do this without affecting the main code in any way.

So to sum up – branches let you make changes to the codebase without affecting the core code until you're absolutely ready to implement those changes.

This helps you keep the codebase clean and organized.if we have 10 dev working on 10 diff features of same repo then we can get messup up,so e will create a branch on our own and then raise a
pr to merge our code to master
generally a branch is same as master/main branch
'
how to create a branch
git checkout -b :branch name"
 -b is used to create a new branch checkout is generally used to jump between the branches 
to delete a branch first switch to different branch and delete the the other branch
